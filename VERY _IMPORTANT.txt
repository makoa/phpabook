VERY IMPORTANT!

This is the phpABook version 0.9 Intermediate.
Please bear in mind this will be the very
last release using this code. The next version
should be not compatible nor upgradeable
without complete removal of the old script INCLUDING DATABASE.

I will do my best to provide easy to follow instructions on how
to upgrade but should ask for extensive work.

Next version will be 1.0 and should be available in mid July 2016
and will feature a new code, new features and new and modern design.
To receive updates, please subscrive to our mailing list.

Thank you for your understanding
